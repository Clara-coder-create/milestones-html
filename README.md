### Semantic HTML and Logical Structure

The browser has no opinion about the *meaning* of your HTML document. Why is the HTML document organized one way versus another? What do your choice of tags and class/ID names represent? Are there conventions you're following?

To the browser, an HTML document consists of a bunch of nested elements. Some of those elements have a default style, but virtually every aspect can be changed via CSS. Using CSS, you can make every `<p>` tag look and act like an `<h1>` tag, if you want.

These *semantics* are important for the author and any other people who want to make sense of the HTML document down the road, including the author's future self.
